# tree

Use `tree` to display directory paths and (optionally) files in each subdirectory. 

When you use the TREE command each directory name is displayed along with the names of any subdirectories within it. The display will be in a format like the summary below. (Different versions of DOS may display the data in a slightly different format.)

First, the root directory and the directories within it are listed:

<img align="left" width="450" src="/home/akram/Downloads/Screenshot from 2019-10-02 10-12-05.jpg" alt="git status" />

## Syntax

TREE (directory name)(folder name)*
*- Optional

## Examples

```tree github
```
<img align="left" width="450" src="/home/akram/Downloads/Screenshot from 2019-10-02 10-12-05.jpg" alt="git status" />
