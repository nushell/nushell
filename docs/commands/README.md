# How do I get started?

Pick any command from the checklist and write a comment acknowledging you started work.

## Instructions for documenting a Nu command of your choosing

Name the file after the command, like so:

`command.md`

Example: If you want to add documentation for the Nu command `enter`, create a file named `enter.md`, write documentation, save it at `/docs/commands/[your_command_picked].md` as  and create your pull request.

## What kind of documentation should I write?

Anything you want that you believe it *best* documents the command and the way you would like to see it. Here are some of our ideas of documentation we would *love* to see (feel free to add yours):

* Examples of using the command (max creativity welcomed!)
* Description of the command.
* Command usage.

## Anything else?

Of course! (These are drafts) so feel free to leave feedback and suggestions in the same file.

Happy Documenting.
