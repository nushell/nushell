Meeting notes (3/6/2020)

Minutes

- `MaybeTextCodec`
    - Reads in 8k buffer of bytes
    - If UTF-8, emits `Primitive::String`s, other `Primitive::Bytes`
    - Loading all data into memory?
        - serde and decoders to see how they play into streaming data
        - Chars iterator instead?
    - `collect_string` and `collect_binary` may need some cleaning up
- open `/dev/urandom` hangs ðŸ˜¬
    - Async http is a thing now, could work for fetch
    - Config to avoid sniffing the stream, just always have raw bytes?
    - Convention wise, how can we make it intuitive
        - Windows still likes UTF-16, so keep in that mind
- named pipes (load data from side channel)
    - Performance concerns, named pipes could deal with this
    - Works on windows too!
    - Focus on things that help adoption
- Lazy field resolution
    - `ps` having port information, but only computing if needed
    - Bidirectional? Pipeline analysis phase?
- Exploring nu
    - Exploring like in an R shell
    - Data frames
        - Imagine a variable that you can ask
            - What columns do you have?
            - How many rows?
    - Commands in namespaces
- nushell as a data processing shell
    - Parallelization? Distributed computing?
    - Cron jobs?
- How do we prioritize?
    1. Fundamentals
        - Aliases / Functions / Variables
        - Make scripting work
        - Completions
            - `ps | where <TAB>`
            - git branches, for example
    2. After the above, anything that helps with adoption
- What is the core team?
    - Diversity
    - How do we bring on new people?
    - How big should the core team be?
    - Should there be a core team, and a committer's team?
        - Rails model
