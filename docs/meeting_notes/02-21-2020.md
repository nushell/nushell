Meeting notes (2/21/2020)

- Aliases
    - [YK] we think this is a blocker â€” let's enumerate blockers?
    - Unblock people from coming into nushell?
    - Should integrate nicely with existing infra
        - E.g., signatures, letting us know issues with input arguments
- Aliases & Variables
    - `foo = "bar"` (YK: iirc you don't object to `$foo = "bar"`)
    - `baz $foo` is the same as `baz $(foo)`
    - YK: I have some questions in the details
    - YK: We need to have a straw man understanding how forcing thunks happens and make sure it's coherent with what we did so far. We don't want to regress UX, for the most part, at least in the repl.
- Blocks
    - Current idea is that a block evaluates to a pipeline, and you then must evaluate the pipeline to get the stream of results.  This allows us to reuse or serialize blocks.
- Fixing OutputStream
    - Fix papercuts
- Gedge's pipeline work
- Nubook
    - Uncouple Nu and the shell
- RFC process including resisting zsh/bash
    - RFC process
        - Decision journal
    - Vision

- Visibility into on-going progress
- Github issues that require triage for design
- Completions
    - There's a big space here to explore
- Gedge's wycats project / how to think about externals
    - Currently: external/internal very different
    - Treat externals like internals, get all the features of internals
    - Level up gedge ðŸ™Œ
- Values:
    - Principal of least surprise should work for externals (parsing and stdin/stdout)
