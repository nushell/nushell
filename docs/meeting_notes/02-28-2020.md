    - For users who aren't looking at Notion all the time
    - More casual — giving an insight into how we think
    - What's a good software for this? @Andrés N. Robalino Mar 13, 2020
    - YK: Ember Times uses [https://goodbits.io/](https://goodbits.io/) (Godfrey used to work on this)
- Build time
    - In the beginning, we had slow build times
    - last time we checked, clap was surprisingly slow
    - let's do another analysis pass
    - YK: contributions to build time can be counterintuitive (note: crates using macros)
- Subcrate refactor
- Symbol renames
    - Context → CommandContext (Context mostly contains fields that commands depend on when being run) Makes sense to rename it and make it more clear.
- Documentation & Contributor guide
    - We can probably document things so that the crate separation helps people contribute better, but it will require a much clearer description of the boundaries and what the purpose of the boundaries are
    - "I'm trying to do X. What components of the system am I going to need to touch?"
    - @Jason Gedge thinks we could be a good place for technical writers to contribute if we do the work to be welcoming to them
- Aliases
    - No major progress to report
    - Still owe a writeup about implementation strategy @Yehuda Katz Mar 13, 2020
- `get foo.bar` vs `get foo | get bar`
    - How to communicate the semantic difference? [YK]
    - `get foo | get bar` means: for each row in the input, get the value of  `$it.foo` and turn that into a table, then iterate over all of the rows in that table and turn the contents of `bar` into a new table
    - `get foo.bar` means: for each row in the input, get `$it.foo.bar` and turn the results into a table
    - it's possible for both of those to be meaningful at the same time, and in general, trying to mash them together into one concept makes it harder for people to form a mental model of what's going on
    - iow, the friction here is because there are two concepts, and you kind of wish it wasn't true
    - @Jonathan Turner - dig out the ambiguity examples of the two approaches
- Protocol
    - JT's proposal
    - lazy field resolution
- Externals
