# Example Nushell Loginshell Config File
# - has to be as login.nu in the default config directory
# - will be sourced after config.nu and env.nu in case of nushell started as login shell

# just as an example for overwriting of an environment variable of env.nu
let-env PROMPT_INDICATOR = { "(LS)〉" }

# Similar to env-path and config-path there is a variable containing the path to login.nu
echo $nu.loginshell-path
