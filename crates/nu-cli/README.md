# nu-cli

This crate provides the fundamental needs when creating the Nushell interactive REPL. In it, you'll find features for interacting with the line editor (the piece which writes the prompt and takes input from the user), keybindings, handlers for the commandline arguments passed to the REPL as it starts up, and more.
