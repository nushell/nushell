# Nushell Config File Documentation
#
# Warning: This file is intended for documentation purposes only and
# is not intended to be used as an actual configuration file as-is.
#
# version = "0.101.1"
#
# A `config.nu` file is used to override default Nushell settings,
# define (or import) custom commands, or run any other startup tasks.
# See https://www.nushell.sh/book/configuration.html
#
# Nushell sets "sensible defaults" for most configuration settings, so
# the user's `config.nu` only needs to override these defaults if
# desired.
#
# This file serves as simple "in-shell" documentation for these
# settings, or you can view a more complete discussion online at:
# https://nushell.sh/book/configuration
#
# You can pretty-print and page this file using:

# $env.config
# -----------
# The $env.config environment variable is a record containing most Nushell
# configuration settings. Keep in mind that, as a record, setting it to a
# new record will remove any keys which aren't in the new record. Nushell
# will then automatically merge in the internal defaults for missing keys.
#
# The same holds true for keys in the $env.config which are also records
# or lists.
#
# For this reason, settings are typically changed by updating the value of
# a particular key. Merging a new config record is also possible. See the
# Configuration chapter of the book for more information.

# ------------------------
# History-related settings
# ------------------------
# $env.config.history.*

# file_format (string):  Either "sqlite" or "plaintext". While text-backed history
# is currently the default for historical reasons, "sqlite" is stable and
# provides more advanced history features.
$env.config.history.file_format = "sqlite"

# max_size (int): The maximum number of entries allowed in the history.
# After exceeding this value, the oldest history items will be removed
# as new commands are added.
$env.config.history.max_size = 5_000_000

# sync_on_enter (bool): Whether the plaintext history file is updated
# each time a command is entered. If set to `false`, the plaintext history
# is only updated/written when the shell exits. This setting has no effect
# for SQLite-backed history.
$env.config.history.sync_on_enter = true

# isolation (bool):
# `true`: New history from other currently-open Nushell sessions is not
# seen when scrolling through the history using PrevHistory (typically
# the Up key) or NextHistory (Down key)
# `false`: All commands entered in other Nushell sessions will be mixed with
# those from the current shell.
# Note: Older history items (from before the current shell was started) are
# always shown.
# This setting only applies to SQLite-backed history
$env.config.history.isolation = true

# ----------------------
# Miscellaneous Settings
# ----------------------

# show_banner (bool): Enable or disable the welcome banner at startup
$env.config.show_banner = true

# rm.always_trash (bool):
# true: rm behaves as if the --trash/-t option is specified
# false: rm behaves as if the --permanent/-p option is specified (default)
# Explicitly calling `rm` with `--trash` or `--permanent` always override this setting
# Note that this feature is dependent on the host OS trashcan support.
$env.config.rm.always_trash = false

# recursion_limit (int): how many times a command can call itself recursively
# before an error will be generated.
$env.config.recursion_limit = 50

# ---------------------------
# Commandline Editor Settings
# ---------------------------

# edit_mode (string) "vi" or "emacs" sets the editing behavior of Reedline
$env.config.edit_mode = "emacs"

# Command that will be used to edit the current line buffer with Ctrl+O.
# If unset, uses $env.VISUAL and then $env.EDITOR
#
# Tip: Set to "editor" to use the default editor on Unix platforms using
#      the Alternatives system or equivalent
$env.config.buffer_editor = "editor"

# cursor_shape_* (string)
# -----------------------
# The following variables accept a string from the following selections:
# "block", "underscore", "line", "blink_block", "blink_underscore", "blink_line", or "inherit"
# "inherit" skips setting cursor shape and uses the current terminal setting.
$env.config.cursor_shape.emacs = "inherit"         # Cursor shape in emacs mode
$env.config.cursor_shape.vi_insert = "block"       # Cursor shape in vi-insert mode
$env.config.cursor_shape.vi_normal = "underscore"  # Cursor shape in normal vi mode

# --------------------
# Completions Behavior
# --------------------
# $env.config.completions.*
# Apply to the Nushell completion system

# algorithm (string): Either "prefix" or "fuzzy"
$env.config.completions.algorithm = "prefix"

# sort (string): One of "smart" or "alphabetical"
# In "smart" mode sort order is based on the "algorithm" setting.
# When using the "prefix" algorithm, results are alphabetically sorted.
# When using the "fuzzy" algorithm, results are sorted based on their fuzzy score.
$env.config.completions.sort = "smart"

# case_sensitive (bool): true/false to enable/disable case-sensitive completions
$env.config.completions.case_sensitive = false

# quick (bool):
# true: auto-select the completion when only one remains
# false: prevents auto-select of the final result
$env.config.completions.quick = true

# partial (bool):
# true: Partially complete up to the best possible match
# false: Do not partially complete
# Partial Example: If a directory contains only files named "forage", "food", and "forest",
#                  then typing "ls " and pressing <Tab> will partially complete the first two
#                  letters, "f" and "o". If the directory also includes a file named "faster",
#                  then only "f" would be partially completed.
$env.config.completions.partial = true

# use_ls_colors (bool): When true, apply LS_COLORS to file/path/directory matches
$env.config.completions.use_ls_colors = true

# --------------------
# External Completions
# --------------------
# completions.external.*: Settings related to completing external commands
# and additional completers

# external.enable (bool)
# true: search for external commands on the Path
# false: disabling might be desired for performance if your path includes
#        directories on a slower filesystem
$env.config.completions.external.enable = true

# max_results (int): Limit the number of external commands retrieved from
# path to this value. Has no effect if `...external.enable` (above) is set to `false`
$env.config.completions.external.max_results = 50

# completer (closure with a |spans| parameter): A command to call for *argument* completions
# to commands (internal or external).
#
# The |spans| parameter is a list of strings representing the tokens (spans)
# on the current commandline. It is always a list of at least two strings - The
# command being completed plus the first argument of that command ("" if no argument has
# been partially typed yet), and additional strings for additional arguments beyond
# the first.
#
# This setting is usually set to a closure which will call a third-party completion system, such
# as Carapace.
#
# Note: The following is an over-simplified completer command that will call Carapace if it
# is installed. Please use the official Carapace completer, which can be generated automatically
# by Carapace itself. See the Carapace documentation for the proper syntax.
$env.config.completions.external.completer = {|spans|

# --------------------
# Terminal Integration
# --------------------
# Nushell can output a number of escape codes to enable advanced features in Terminal Emulators
# that support them. Settings in this section enable or disable these features in Nushell.
# Features aren't supported by your Terminal can be disabled. Features can also be disabled,
#  of course, if there is a conflict between the Nushell and Terminal's implementation.

# use_kitty_protocol (bool):
# A keyboard enhancement protocol supported by the Kitty Terminal. Additional keybindings are
# available when using this protocol in a supported terminal. For example, without this protocol,
# Ctrl+I is interpreted as the Tab Key. With this protocol, Ctrl+I and Tab can be mapped separately.
$env.config.use_kitty_protocol = false

# osc2 (bool):
# When true, the current directory and running command are shown in the terminal tab/window title.
# Also abbreviates the directory name by prepending ~ to the home directory and its subdirectories.
$env.config.shell_integration.osc2 = true

# osc7 (bool):
# Nushell will report the current directory to the terminal using OSC 7. This is useful when
# spawning new tabs in the same directory.
$env.config.shell_integration.osc7 = true

# osc9_9 (bool):
# Enables/Disables OSC 9;9 support, originally a ConEmu terminal feature. This is an
# alternative to OSC 7 which also communicates the current path to the terminal.
$env.config.shell_integration.osc9_9 = false

# osc8 (bool):
# When true, the `ls` command will generate clickable links that can be launched in another
# application by the terminal.
# Note: This setting replaces the now deprecated `ls.clickable_links`
$env.config.shell_integration.osc8 = true

# Deprecated
# $env.config.ls.clickable_links = true

# osc133 (bool):
# true/false to enable/disable OSC 133 support, a set of several escape sequences which
# report the (1) starting location of the prompt, (2) ending location of the prompt,
# (3) starting location of the command output, and (4) the exit code of the command.

# originating with Final Term. These sequences report information regarding the prompt
# location as well as command status to the terminal. This enables advanced features in
# some terminals, including the ability to provide separate background colors for the
# command vs. the output, collapsible output, or keybindings to scroll between prompts.
$env.config.shell_integration.osc133 = true

# osc633 (bool):

# This sequence is commonly used to keep cursor key modes in sync between the local
# terminal and a remove SSH host.
$env.config.shell_integration.reset_application_mode = true

# bracketed_paste (bool):
# true/false to enable/disable the bracketed-paste feature, which allows multiple-lines
# to be pasted into Nushell at once without immediate execution. When disabled,

# Note that bracketed paste is not currently supported on the Windows version of
# Nushell.
$env.config.bracketed_paste = true

# use_ansi_coloring ("auto" or bool):
# The default value `"auto"` dynamically determines if ANSI coloring is used.
# It evaluates the following environment variables in decreasingly priority:
# `FORCE_COLOR`, `NO_COLOR`, and `CLICOLOR`.
# - If `FORCE_COLOR` is set, coloring is always enabled.
# - If `NO_COLOR` is set, coloring is disabled.
# - If `CLICOLOR` is set, its value (0 or 1) decides whether coloring is used.
# If none of these are set, it checks whether the standard output is a terminal
# and enables coloring if it is.
# A value of `true` or `false` overrides this behavior, explicitly enabling or
# disabling ANSI coloring in Nushell's internal commands.
# When disabled, built-in commands will only use the default foreground color.
# Note: This setting does not affect the `ansi` command.

# color_config (record): A record of shapes, types, UI elements, etc. that can be styled (e.g.,
# colorized) in Nushell, either on the commandline itself (shapes) or in output.
#
# Note that this is usually set through a theme provided by a record in a custom command. For
# instance, the standard library contains two "starter" theme commands: "dark-theme" and
# "light-theme". For example:
use std/config dark-theme
$env.config.color_config = (dark-theme)

# Or, individual color settings can be configured or overridden.
#
# Values can be one of:
# - A color name such as "red" (see `ansi -l` for a list)
# - A color RGB value in the form of "#C4C9C6"
# - A record including:
#   * `fg` (color)
#   * `bg` (color)
#   * `attr`: a string with one or more of:

# color.config.<type>
# *Values* of a particular *type* can be styled differently than the *shape*.
# Note that the style is applied only when this type is displayed in *structured* data (list,
# record, or table). It is not currently applied to basic raw values.
#
# Note that some types are rarely or never seen in a context in which styling would be applied.
# For example, a cell-path *value* is unlikely to (but can) appear in a list, record, or table.
#
# Tip: In addition to the styles above (fg, bg, attr), types typically accept a closure which can
# dynamically change the style based on the *value*. For instance, the themes in the nu_scripts
# repository will style filesizes difference in an `ls` (or other table) differently depending on
# their magnitude.

# Simple examples:

# bool: A boolean value
$env.config.color_config.bool = {||
  if $in {
    {
      bg: 'light_green'
      fg: 'white'
      attr: 'b'

      bg: 'yellow'
      fg: 'black'
      attr: 'b'
    }
  }
}

# int: An integer value
$env.config.color_config.int = {||
  if $in == 42 { 'green' } else { 'red' }
}

# Additional type values (without examples):
$env.config.color_config.string      # String
$env.config.color_config.float       # Float value
$env.config.color_config.glob        # Glob value (must be declared)
$env.config.color_config.binary      # Binary value
$env.config.color_config.custom      # Custom value (often from a plugin)
$env.config.color_config.nothing     # Not used, since a null is not displayed
$env.config.color_config.date        # datetime value
$env.config.color_config.filesize    # filesize value

# empty: This style is applied to empty/missing values in a table. However, since the ❎
# emoji is used for this purpose, there is limited styling that can be applied.
$env.config.color_config.empty

# leading_trailing_space_bg: When a string value inside structured data has leading or trailing
# whitespace, that whitespace will be displayed using this style.
# Use { attr: n } to disable.

# `explore` command colors
# ------------------------
# Configure the UI colors of the `explore` command
# Allowed values are the same as for the `color_config` options above.
# Example:

}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environment Variables
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# In addition to the $env.config record, a number of other environment variables
# also affect Nushell's behavior:

# PROMPT_*
# --------
# Prompt configuration
# PROMPT_ variables accept either a string or a closure that returns a string

# PROMPT_COMMAND
# --------------
# Defines the primary prompt. Note that the PROMPT_INDICATOR (below) is appended to this value.
# Simple example - Static string:
$env.PROMPT_COMMAND = "Nushell"
# Simple example - Dynamic closure displaying the path:
$env.PROMPT_COMMAND = {|| pwd}

# PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT
# --------------------
# Defines a prompt which will appear right-aligned in the terminal
$env.PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT = {|| date now | format date "%d-%a %r" }

# PROMPT_INDICATOR*
# -----------------
# The prompt indicators are environmental variables that represent
# the state of the prompt. The specified character(s) will appear
# immediately following the PROMPT_COMMAND

# When in Emacs mode (default):
$env.PROMPT_INDICATOR = "> "

# When in normal vi mode:
$env.PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_NORMAL = "> "
# When in vi insert-mode:
$env.PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_INSERT = ": "

# When a commandline extends across multiple lines:
$env.PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR = "::: "

# TRANSIENT_PROMPT_*
# ------------------
# Allows a different prompt to be shown after a command has been executed.  This
# can be useful if you have a 2-line prompt. Instead of each previously-entered
# command taking up at least 2 lines, the transient prompt can condense it to a
# shorter version. The following example shows a rocket emoji before each
# previously-entered command:
$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND = "🚀 "
$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR = ""
$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_INSERT = ""
$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_NORMAL = ""
# Tip: Removing the transient multiline indicator and right-prompt can simplify
#      copying from the terminal
$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR = ""
$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT = ""

# ENV_CONVERSIONS
# ---------------
# Certain variables, such as those containing multiple paths, are often stored as a
# colon-separated string in other shells. Nushell can convert these automatically to a
# more convenient Nushell list.  The ENV_CONVERSIONS variable specifies how environment
# variables are:
# - converted from a string to a value on Nushell startup (from_string)
# - converted from a value back to a string when running external commands (to_string)
#
# Note: The OS Path variable is automatically converted before env.nu loads, so it can
# be treated a list in this file.
#
# Note: Environment variables are not case-sensitive, so the following will work
# for both Windows and Unix-like platforms.
#
# By default, the internal conversion looks something like the following, so there
# is no need to add this in your actual env.nu:
$env.ENV_CONVERSIONS = {
    "Path": {
        from_string: { |s| $s | split row (char esep) | path expand --no-symlink }
        to_string: { |v| $v | path expand --no-symlink | str join (char esep) }
    }
}

# Here's an example converts the XDG_DATA_DIRS variable to and from a list:
$env.ENV_CONVERSIONS = $env.ENV_CONVERSIONS | merge {
    "XDG_DATA_DIRS": {
        from_string: { |s| $s | split row (char esep) | path expand --no-symlink }
        to_string: { |v| $v | path expand --no-symlink | str join (char esep) }
    }
}
#
# Other common directory-lists for conversion: TERMINFO_DIRS.
# Note that other variable conversions take place after `config.nu` is loaded.

# NU_LIB_DIRS
# -----------
# Directories in this constant are searched by the
# `use` and `source` commands.
#
# By default, the `scripts` subdirectory of the default configuration
# directory is included:
const NU_LIB_DIRS = [
    ($nu.default-config-dir | path join 'scripts') # add <nushell-config-dir>/scripts
    ($nu.data-dir | path join 'completions') # default home for nushell completions
]
# You can replace (override) or append to this list by shadowing the constant
const NU_LIB_DIRS = $NU_LIB_DIRS ++ [($nu.default-config-dir | path join 'modules')]

# An environment variable version of this also exists. It is searched after the constant.
$env.NU_LIB_DIRS ++= [ ($nu.data-dir | path join "nu_scripts") ]

# NU_PLUGIN_DIRS
# --------------
# Directories to search for plugin binaries when calling add.

# By default, the `plugins` subdirectory of the default configuration
# directory is included:
const NU_PLUGIN_DIRS = [
    ($nu.default-config-dir | path join 'plugins') # add <nushell-config-dir>/plugins
]
# You can replace (override) or append to this list by shadowing the constant
const NU_PLUGIN_DIRS = $NU_PLUGIN_DIRS ++ [($nu.default-config-dir | path join 'plugins')]

# As with NU_LIB_DIRS, an $env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS is searched after the constant version

# Appending to the OS path is a common configuration task.
# Because of the previous ENV_CONVERSIONS (performed internally
# before your config.nu loads), the path variable is a list that can
# be appended to using, for example:
$env.PATH ++= [ "~/.local/bin" ]

# Or prepend using
$env.PATH = [ "~/.local/bin" ] ++ $env.PATH

# The `path add` function from the Standard Library also provides
# a convenience method for prepending to the path:
use std/util "path add"
path add "~/.local/bin"
path add ($env.CARGO_HOME | path join "bin")

# You can remove duplicate directories from the path using:
$env.PATH = ($env.PATH | uniq)
