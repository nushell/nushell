/// The API for a Nushell plugin command
///
/// This is the trait that Nushell plugin commands must implement. The methods defined on
/// `PluginCommand` are invoked by [serve_plugin] during plugin registration and execution.
///
/// The plugin command must be able to be safely shared between threads, so that multiple
/// invocations can be run in parallel. If interior mutability is desired, consider synchronization
/// primitives such as [mutexes](std::sync::Mutex) and [channels](std::sync::mpsc).
///
/// This version of the trait expects stream input and output. If you have a simple plugin that just
/// operates on plain values, consider using [`SimplePluginCommand`] instead.
///
/// # Examples
/// Basic usage:
/// ```
/// # use nu_plugin::*;
/// # use nu_protocol::{PluginSignature, PipelineData, Type, Value, LabeledError};
/// struct LowercasePlugin;
/// struct Lowercase;
///
/// impl PluginCommand for Lowercase {
///     type Plugin = LowercasePlugin;
///
///     fn signature(&self) -> PluginSignature {
///         PluginSignature::build("lowercase")
///             .usage("Convert each string in a stream to lowercase")
