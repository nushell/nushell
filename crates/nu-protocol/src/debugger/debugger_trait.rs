//! Traits related to debugging
//!
//! The purpose of DebugContext is achieving static dispatch on `eval_xxx()` calls.
//! The main Debugger trait is intended to be used as a trait object.
//!
//! The debugging information is stored in `EngineState` as the `debugger` field storing a `Debugger`
//! trait object behind `Arc` and `Mutex`. To evaluate something (e.g., a block), first create a
//! `Debugger` trait object (such as the `Profiler`). Then, add it to engine state via
//! `engine_state.activate_debugger()`. This sets the internal state of EngineState to the debugging
//! mode and calls `Debugger::activate()`. Now, you can call `eval_xxx::<WithDebug>()`. When you're
//! done, call `engine_state.deactivate_debugger()` which calls `Debugger::deactivate()`, sets the
//! EngineState into non-debugging mode, and returns the original mutated `Debugger` trait object.
//! (`NoopDebugger` is placed in its place inside `EngineState`.) After deactivating, you can call
//! `Debugger::report()` to get some output from the debugger, if necessary.
