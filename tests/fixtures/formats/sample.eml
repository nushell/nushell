We recently have determined that different computers
have logged onto your eBay account, and multiple
password failures were present before the logons. We
now need you to re-confirm your account information to
us. If this is not completed by <strong>November 30,
2004</strong>, we will be forced to suspend your
account indefinitely, as it may have been used for
fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation
in this manner.</FONT>
