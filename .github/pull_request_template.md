# Tests

Make sure you've done the following:

- [ ] Add tests that cover your changes, either in the command examples, the crate/tests folder, or in the /tests folder.
- [ ] Try to think about corner cases and various ways how your changes could break. Cover them with tests.
- [ ] If adding tests is not possible, please document in the PR body a minimal example with steps on how to reproduce so one can verify your change works.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo fmt --all` applies these changes)
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace --features=extra -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -A clippy::needless_collect` to check that you're using the standard code style
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace --features=extra` to check that all the tests pass

# Documentation

- [ ] If your PR touches a user-facing nushell feature then make sure that there is an entry in the documentation (https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io) for the feature, and update it if necessary.
