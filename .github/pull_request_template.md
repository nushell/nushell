# Tests + Formatting

Don't forget to add tests that cover your changes.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- `make fmt-check` to check standard code formatting (`make fmt` applies these changes)
- `make clippy` to check that you're using the standard code style
- `make test` to check that all tests pass

# After Submitting

If your PR had any user-facing changes, update [the documentation](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io) after the PR is merged, if necessary. This will help us keep the docs up to date.
