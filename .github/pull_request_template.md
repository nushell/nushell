# User-Facing Changes
<!-- List of all changes that impact the user experience here. This helps us keep track of breaking changes. -->

# Tests + Formatting
<!--
Don't forget to add tests that cover your changes.

Make sure you've run and fixed any issues with these commands:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to check standard code formatting (`cargo fmt --all` applies these changes)
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used` to check that you're using the standard code style
- `cargo test --workspace` to check that all tests pass (on Windows make sure to [enable developer mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/developer-mode-features-and-debugging))
- `cargo run -- -c "use toolkit.nu; toolkit test stdlib"` to run the tests for the standard library

> **Note**
> from `nushell` you can also use the `toolkit` as follows
> ```bash
> use toolkit.nu  # or use an `env_change` hook to activate it automatically
> toolkit check pr
> ```
