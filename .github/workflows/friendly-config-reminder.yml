          Hey, just a bot checking in! You edited files related to the configuration.
          If you changed any of the default values or added a new config option, don't forget to update the [`doc_config.nu`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-utils/src/default_files/doc_config.nu) which documents the options for our users including the defaults provided by the Rust implementation.
          If you didn't make a change here, you can just ignore me.
